# Source Code

The `src/` directory contains the source code for the Brain-to-Text 25 project, organized by modules and functions.

Subdirectories:
- `data/` – Data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation scripts.
- `models/` – Model architectures, training loops, and saving/loading logic.
- `features/` – Feature extraction and engineering utilities.
- `evaluation/` – Metric computations and validation routines.
- `inference/` – Scripts and functions to perform inference and generate predictions.

To make your code reusable, consider writing functions and classes here rather than embedding logic inside notebooks or scripts.
