# Outputs

This directory stores output artifacts generated during experiments, including:

- `logs/` – Training and evaluation logs.
- `checkpoints/` – Model checkpoints and weights.
- `submissions/` – Generated submission files (e.g., CSVs for Kaggle leaderboard).

Do not commit large binary files or datasets here. Use git LFS or external storage if needed, and keep only small or critical artifacts.
