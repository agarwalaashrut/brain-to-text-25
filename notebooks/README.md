# Notebooks

This directory holds Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature exploration, and experimental models for the Brain-to-Text 25 competition.

Guidelines:
- Use separate notebooks for different experiments (e.g., `eda_avirup.ipynb`, `model_baseline.ipynb`) to avoid merge conflicts.
- Clear notebook outputs before committing to keep diffs clean (in Jupyter: Kernel > Restart & Clear Output or use nbstripout pre-commit).
- For long-running experiments, consider moving code to scripts in the `src/` directory.
